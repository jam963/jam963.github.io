I'm a PhD candidate in [Romance Studies][romance] with a minor in [Cognitive Science][cogsci] at Cornell. 

My current interests include: 
- representational analysis of language and embedding models
- human and machine language processing, particularly of literary texts 
- adapting methods from computational linguistics and NLP for humanities research.

My graduate committee is [Laurent Dubreuil][laurent] (chair), [Morten Christiansen][morten], and [Shimon Edelman][edelman].

I also collaborate with people in:
- [C.Psyd][cpsyd]
- [Humanities Lab at Cornell][humlab]
- [Cornell NLP][nlp]
