I'm a PhD candidate in [Romance Studies][romance] with a minor in [Cognitive Science][cogsci] at Cornell. I received my BA in French and Francophone Studies from Columbia in 2019.

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in applying computational and experimental methods within the humanities, particularly in literary and area studies. 

My current research areas include: 
- representational analysis of language and embedding models
- differences between human and machine language processing 
- literary theory (Gilles Deleuze, Michel Serres) and cognition.

My graduate committee is [Laurent Dubreuil][laurent] (chair), [Morten Christiansen][morten], and [Shimon Edelman][edelman].

I also collaborate with people in:
- [C.Psyd][cpsyd]
- [Humanities Lab at Cornell][humlab]
- [Cornell NLP][nlp]

Some recent and ongoing projects:
